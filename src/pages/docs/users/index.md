# Cloudstream
An Android app to stream and download Movies, TV-Shows and Animes
This [open source app](https://github.com/recloudstream/cloudstream) can stream any media content from various sources

Check out the [FAQ](../faq.md) first!

### Disclaimer ⚠️
The app is purely for educational and personal use.

CloudStream 3 does not host any content on the app, and has no control over what media is put up or taken down. CloudStream 3 functions like any other search engine, such as Google. CloudStream 3 does not host, upload or manage any videos, films or content. It simply crawls, aggregates and displayes links in a convenient, user-friendly interface.

It merely scrapes 3rd-party websites that are publicly accessible via any regular web browser.

It is the responsibility of the user to avoid any actions that might violate the laws governing his or her locality.

### What are the risks in practice?
Basically none. The content is hosted by the "providers", and if you don't distribute the content yourself, you are pretty much safe

A lot of misleading articles online try to scare people into buying a VPN subscription when the authors are earning a big commission (sometimes 100% of the VPN subscription).
VPNs are useful for certain things but aren't a magical tool and most people don't need those

## Features

### Streaming

You can stream media from various sources (developed by the community)

### Downloading

You can download media (movies, series and animes) files anywhere on your phone or external storage

### Searching

When you search for a media, Cloudstream will search every provider to see if it has that media or not.

You can change the list of used providers with the settings button in the search page

You can also enable foreign language providers (such as French) under:

Settings page > Provider Languages

and tick the ones you want there

### 100% free and no ads!

Cloudstream-3 (also refered to as Cs3) is open-source, that means that anyone can look at the code, their isn't any invasive data collection and anyone can create their own modifed version

This app doesn't contain any ads and is completely free to download, as a result this app doesn't make any money from someone using the app.

But you can still help it's development:

- By contributing to the code of the app itself (requires knowledge of Kotlin)
- By translating the app in another language
- By adding a star to the project on github
- By donating money to dependencies of the project (requires money) *The devs of Cloudstream-3 don't accept donations*
